# Spacing

**Spacing** is a web application built using Django, SQLite, RESTFUL Routes with a few more frameworks and middle-wares used as the application is developed. This application is used to help people memorize anything they want to build as long-term memory. Which is according to the [learning curve] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve) that was identified by [Hermann Ebbinghaus] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus).

## Description

### Forgetting curve
The [forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve) hypothesizes the decline of memory retention in time. This curve shows how information is lost over time when there is no attempt to retain it.[1] A related concept is the strength of memory that refers to the durability that memory traces in the brain. The stronger the memory, the longer period of time that a person is able to recall it. A typical graph of the forgetting curve purports to show that humans tend to halve their memory of newly learned knowledge in a matter of days or weeks unless they consciously review the learned material.
